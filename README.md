# Snort-2.9.20-Windows-Config
Default Windows Config File for Snort 2.9.20
<br />
I had some issues installing Snort and this is the edited snort.conf file that got it working so hopefully this helps someone else.
<br />
Make sure you install "snortrules-snapshot-29200.tar.gz" from https://www.snort.org/downloads and place this edited snort.conf file inside C:\Snort\etc\
